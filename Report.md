# Documenting my Work
I had to add low_memory error due to issue of uploading inpatient data in google collab notebook
I had to show the first few rows of the dataset
Found columns that relate to ICD, DRG, and HCPCS Codes
I then found missing codes for ICD and DRG except for HCPCS
I ended finding the frequency of each type of the medical codexes
The most common codes are stated in each of the medical codexes
In terms of patterns and analysis, some of the codes appeared in some of the same medical codexes. 
Examples: 
E8881, R7303: ICD_DGNS_CD13, ICD_DGNS_CD19 
F13: ICD_PRCDR_CD18, ICD_PRCDR_CD23, ICD_PRCDR_CD10
BW03ZZZ:  ICD_PRCDR_CD2,  ICD_PRCDR_CD10
In terms of the names of each code:
E8881 - metabolic syndrome and other insulin resistance
R7303 - Pre Diabetes
F13 -  sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics related disorders
BWO3ZZZ - Plain Radiography of Chest
